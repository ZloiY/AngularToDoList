 -- build - simply build the project to dist directory;
 -- start - start dev server on localhost:9000 with support of live reload;
 -- clean - delete build directory
 -- unit_tests - for running unit tests;
 -- e2e_server - starts server that uses for e2e testing;
 -- e2e_tests - starts e2e testing(need e2e_server to be on).
